# Meld Encrypt+
⚠️ ATTENTION ⚠️
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! PLEASE SAVE YOUR PASSWORD SAFELY!

This plugin is a modified version of the original [Meld Encrypt](https://github.com/meld-cp/obsidian-encrypt) plugin. Now you can use the right click menu of folder to encrypt the entire folder. For the simplicity consideration, I remove the session password decrypt for folder senario. To decrypt the folder must input password by hands.

The consistancy is not optimized yet. Meanwhile if you have encrypted file using differnet password compare with the folder one, the decryption of folder will failed.

# Obsidian Encrypt Plugin

**Create encrypted notes within your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) vault.**

Encrypted notes are never decrypted to disk giving you peace-of-mind that the decrypted contents haven't been sync'd or backed up to external systems.


> ⚠️ WARNING - Use at your own risk ⚠️
> - Your passwords are never stored anywhere, if you forget your passwords you can't decrypt your notes.
> - No known audits have been undertaken for the soundness of encryption methods being used.  Unwanted decryption by a 3rd party may be possible if they have access to your files.
> - Bugs could be introduced to the software at anytime, you are responsible for having backups of your notes.

## ⚜️ Installation

You can install the plugin via the Community Plugins tab within Obsidian by searching for "Meld Encrypt"
